A simple script to download audio/video from youtube.

It allows to download a link immediately or add to a list
of to-be-downloaded videos. A get-all option will download
the videos from the outstanding list.

This script is largely a wrapper over the nice pytube
package, made for personal use.

Requirements:
* pytube
